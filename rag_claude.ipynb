      "\n",
      "- The P100 PCIe version has a single-unit price of $9,430 before any discounts. Higher-end models with more memory and NVLink are even more expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A refurbished P100 GPU is listed on Amazon for a high price, though the exact amount is not given. The listing mentions \"You pay $0 for repairs\" under an extended warranty, implying the base cost is substantial.\n",
